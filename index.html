            This list is kept and updated by the 2builders12rules team. This is NOT the entire list or the official
            list. This is just what we have compiled from what people have reported in our discord (linked at the top).
            This means that these lists may also not be completely accurate but we do our best to verify the lists and
            keep them as up to date as possible.
          </h4>
          <h5 id="titleSubmit">
            To report a punishment, join our discord and let us know your Minecraft username, your punishment, and the
            reason if you know it.

          This is a list of <strong>KNOWN</strong> punishments on 2b2t. <br />
          Some punishments listed below can be temporary (days, months and sometimes years), and in rare cases, some can
          be permanent. Prio stripping is an exception and is immediate.
        </h3>
        <div class="disabled" id="punishmentTxt">
          <strong>Mute: </strong>Unable to send chat messages. Also known as a "Soft Mute". <br />
          <strong>PM Mute: </strong>Unable to send private messages with commands like /msg, /w, /l, /t or any other
          commands that allow you to send private messages. Also known as a "Whisper Mute". <br />
          <strong>Hard Mute: </strong>Mute & PM Mute. Unable to communicate through server chat at all. <br />
          <strong>Prio Strip: </strong>Priority queue is removed before it should be removed (before the month is over).
          <br />
          <strong>Prio Ban: </strong>Priority queue is removed and you are unable to buy it again. <br />
          <strong>Blacklist: </strong>All blacklisted accounts get kicked from queue or game regularly (aka shadow
          banning). <br />
          <strong>IP Ban: </strong>If a player is IP Banned, any accounts they log into will be prio banned, hard muted,
          and/or added to the blacklist. <br />
          <strong>Paypal Ban: </strong>Similar to IP Ban but your paypal purchase history on 2b2t webstore is used
          instead to prio ban every account you have ever bought prio for. <br />
          <strong>Hard Ban: </strong>Unable to join the server/queue at all. <br />
          <strong>Death Mute: </strong>Kills and Deaths that involve you will no longer send to chat. <br />
          <strong>Sign Mute: </strong>You can no longer write on signs. <br />
        </div>
        <h3 class="disabled" id="rulesTtl">
          These are the rules we have discovered on 2b2t that are usually followed (as in when someone breaks one of
          these rules they are usually punished). There are probably more rules that we do not know and there are
          probably times where these rules will be broken with no punishment. These are things we have done at some
          point and been punished for and still believe are active.
        </h3>
        <div class="disabled" id="rulesTxt">
          <strong>1.</strong> No Advertising in chat. <br />
          <strong>2.</strong> No Lagging or crashing the server (even unintentionally). <br />
          <strong>3.</strong> Don't use mass kick exploits to kick other players. <br />
          <strong>4.</strong> Don't use a ban exploit to ban a large amount of players. <br />
          <strong>5.</strong> Don't talk about Hause's cocaine addiction or offend him in chat. <br />
          <strong>6.</strong> Don't Spam chat. <br />
          <strong>7.</strong> Duping items may result in a prio strip. <br />
          <strong>8.</strong> Don't Have anything against the rules (eg cocaine or coke) in your Minecraft username.
          <br />
          <strong>9.</strong> No Doxxing or dox threats (even if it's not serious). <br />
          <strong>10.</strong> Using an alt account to bypass prio bans (ban evading) results in a prio ban or IP
          banning. <br />
          <strong>11.</strong> Saying anything to do with Walden will result in a mute, hard mute, prio strip, or prio
          ban. <br />
          <strong>12.</strong> Posting the rules in chat or talking about the rules or punishments may result in a ban
          or mute. <br />
